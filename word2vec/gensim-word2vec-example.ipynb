       " ' the question came about as a result of a five dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way:\\nalexander adell and bertram lupov were two of the faithful attendants of multivac',\n",
       " ' as well as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the cold, clicking, flashing face -- miles and miles of face -- of that giant computer',\n",

       " ' it had to be, for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough -- so adell and lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, yet as well as any men could',\n",
       " ' they fed it data, adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued',\n",
       " \" certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share in the glory that was multivac's\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\nfor decades, multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach the moon, mars, and venus, but past that, earth's poor resources could not support the ships\",\n",

       " ' earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency, but there was only so much of both',\n",
       " '\\n\\nbut slowly multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on may 14, 2061, what had been theory, became fact',\n",

       " '\\n\\nseven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and adell and lupov finally managed to escape from the public function, and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them, in the deserted underground chambers, where portions of the mighty buried body of multivac showed',\n",
